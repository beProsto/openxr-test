## OpenXR Test

### This project will be my sort of an OpenXR playground.

For now I haven't gotten to the "implementing openxr" part yet, as I don't have access to tools to test it all out.

You may ask why I've gone with this project being built by literally anything else than a Makefile

I don't have an answer

I like playing around with it i guess

You may also ask why I've chosen to use [`GLFW`](https://www.glfw.org/) instead of [`OWL`](https://github.com/beProsto/OWL). It's actually really simple: the examples are made with glfw.

Also I wanted to test out [`GLAD`](https://glad.dav1d.de/) so that's here too lol.
